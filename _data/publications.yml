      We study a heterogeneous asset pricing model in which different classes of investors coexist and evolve,
      switching among strategies over time according to a fitness measure. In the presence of boundedly rational
      agents, with biased forecasts and trend-following rules, we study the effect of two types of speculation:
      one based on fundamentalist and the other on rational expectations. While the first is only based on knowledge
      of the asset's underlying dynamics, the second takes also into account the behavior of other investors.
      We bring the model to data by estimating it on the Bitcoin Market with two contributions. First, we construct
      the Bitcoin Twitter Sentiment Index (BiTSI) to proxy a time-varying bias. Second, we propose a new method
      based on a Neural Network for the estimation of the resulting heterogeneous agent model with rational speculators.
      We show that the switching finds support in the data and that while fundamentalist speculation amplifies volatility,
      rational speculation has a stabilizing effect on the market.

      This paper investigates the interplay between information diffusion in social networks and its impact on
      financial markets with an agent based model (ABM). Agents receive and exchange information about an observable
      stochastic component of the dividend process of a risky asset à la Grossman and Stiglitz (1980). A small
      proportion of the network has access to a private signal about the component, which can be clean (information)
      or distorted (misinformation). Other agents are uninformed and can receive information only from their peers.
      All agents are Bayesian in updating their beliefs, but they are so in a behavioural way: in the construction of
      the likelihood function, they replace true precision with an individual parameter which depends on an endogenous
      and time evolving measure of the agent confidence in the source of the information. We examine, by means of
      simulations, how information diffuses in the network and provide a framework to account for delayed absorption
      of shocks that are not immediately priced as predicted by classical financial models. We show the effect of the
      network topology on the resulting asset price and offer an interpretation for excess volatility with respect to
      fundamentals, persistence amplification, and lepto-kurtosis of returns.
