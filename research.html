                            We study an heterogenous asset pricing model in which different classes of in-
                            vestors coexist and evolve, switching among strategies over time according to a fit-
                            ness measure. In the presence of boundedly rational agents, with biased forecasts and
                            trend following rules, we study the effect of two types of speculation: one based on
                            fundamentalist and the other on rational expectations. While the first is only based on
                            knowledge of the asset underlying dynamics, the second takes also into account the
                            behavior of other investors. We bring the model to data by estimating it on the Bitcoin
                            Market with two contributions. First, we construct the Bitcoin Twitter Sentiment Index
                            (BiTSI) to proxy a time varying bias. Second, we propose a new method based on a
                            Neural Network, for the estimation of the resulting heterogeneous agent model with
                            rational speculators. We show that the switching finds support in the data and that
                            while fundamentalist speculation amplifies volatility, rational speculation has a stabi-
                            lizing effect on the market.</p>

                        <p>This paper investigates the interplay between information diffusion in social net-
                            works and its impact on financial markets with an agent based model (ABM). Agents
                            receive and exchange information about an observable stochastic component of the
                            dividend process of a risky asset `a la Grossman and Stiglitz (1980). A small propor-
                            tion of the network has access to a private signal about the component, which can be
                            clean (information) or distorted (misinformation). Other agents are uninformed and
                            can receive information only from their peers. All agents are Bayesian in updating
                            their beliefs, but they are so in a behavioural way, so that in the construction of the
                            likelihood function, they replace true precision with an individual parameter which
                            depends on an endogenous and time evolving measure of the agent confidence in the
                            source of the information. We examine, by means of simulations, how information
                            diffuses in the network and provide a framework to account for delayed absorption of
                            shocks, that are not immediately priced as predicted by classical financial models. We
                            show the effect of the network topology on the resulting asset price and offer an inter-
                            pretation for excess volatility with respect to fundamentals, persistence amplification
                            and lepto-kurtosis of returns</p>
